# netflix-visualizations
A codecademy project

The Python code I used to create the graphs shown in my powerpoint presentation. The data used was a combination of Netflix stock prices over 2017 as well as the stock price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

4 plots were created:
- Violin Plot (to show the distribution of the stock price)
- A plot to compare the earnings per share (EPS) and the prediction EPS
- A plot to show the difference between Revenue and Earnings
- A plot comparing the trend of the closing price to the closing price of the DOWJ.
